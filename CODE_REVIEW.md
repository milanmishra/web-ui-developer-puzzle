#### CODE REVIEW - TASK 1 ####
 
The 'okreads' app allows you to search for books and add them to your reading list.
We can also remove the added books from the reading list. 
The application uses Angular for front-end experience, NGRX for creating store that 
maintains the data which is shared across multiple components, and NestJs for building 
scalable Node.js server-side application. We have used NX(nrwl) for creating Monorepo 
which contains both the frontend and the backend of the application in one place. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### CODE SMELLS AND IMPROVEMENTS:
    1. File - book-search.component.html
            The template contains a date function to change the format of the date. 

        ```
            <strong>Published:</strong> {{ formatDate(b.publishedDate) }}

        ```
            
            Instead of using a function, we can use an angular date pipe to change the format.
            Pipes are useful because you can use them throughout your application, while 
            only declaring each pipe once.
        
        ```
            <strong>Published:</strong> {{ b.publishedDate | date: 'dd/MM/yyyy' }}

        ```
    

    2. File - book-search.component.ts
             In the below-given code, we do not have any error hook for subscribe, which 
             makes it difficult to handle any exception.

        ```
              this.store.select(getAllBooks).subscribe(books => {
                this.books = books;
               });

        ```


    3. Proper naming conventions were not used in some class names. It should always be 
       `Kebab-case`
         ** For example in file: book-search.component.html
        
        ``` 
                <div class="book--title">
                <div class="book--content">
                <div class="book--content--cover">
        ```
             it should be
        
        ```     
                 <div class="book-title">
                 <div class="book-content">
                 <div class="book-content-cover">
        ```
        ** End-to-End (E2E) test file names


    4. Do name end-to-end test specification files after the feature they test, with 
       a suffix of .e2e-spec.

        Because it provides a consistent way to quickly identify end-to-end tests and provides 
        pattern matching for test runners and build automation. 

        ```
                 File: reading-list.spec.ts & search-books.specs.ts 

                 should be with e2e-spec suffix.

                 reading-list.e2e-spec.ts & search-books.e2e-spec.ts

        ```

   
    5. File: book-search.component.ts
        To prevent memory leak we can use async pipe instead of subscription, for retreiving books.

        ```
                books$ = this.store.select(getAllBooks);
                Use Observable like shown above, remove ngOnInit() to remove subscribe.

        ```
        book-search.component.html 

        ```
                *ngFor="let b of books$ | async"

        ```
        Using of `subscribe()` introduces complementary need to unsubscribe at the end of 
        the component life-cycle to avoid memory leaks. We have to unsubscribe it manually.
        Angular handles subscriptions of `| async` pipes for us automatically so there is no 
        need to unsubscribe manually in the component using ngOnDestroy. This leads to less 
        verbosity and hence less possibilities for making a mistake.


    6. File: total-count.component.ts

        ```
                ngOnInit(): void {}

        ```
        We should not import Angular lifecycle hooks without it's utilization. 
        It is a good practice to keep the code size in mind.


    7. It is a good practice to use arrow functions of ES6 instead of normal functions.
         
         File: book-search.component.ts

        ```
                searchExample = () => {}
                searchBooks = () => {}
        ```

        File: reading-list.component.ts

        ```
                removeFromReadingList = (item) => {}
        ```
    
    
    8. File: book-serch.component.html
        We can add form validation for book search field. The search button should
        be disabled if the search field is empty.
        
        ```
                [disabled] = "!searchForm.valid"

        ```

         file: book-search.component.ts

        ```
                  searchForm = this.fb.group({
                  term: new FormControl(null, [Validators.required])        
        ```


    9. Incorrect description for reading list reducer test case and book search 
        component test case.
        We should always provide a meaningful and correct test case descriptions.

        -> File: reading-list.reducer.spec.ts

        ```
                describe('Books Reducer', () => {}
                describe('valid Books actions', () => {}
        ```

            As the test cases are for reading list the description should be related to
            reading list.
        
        ```
    
                describe('Reading List Reducer', () => {}
                describe('valid Reading List actions', () => {}
        ```

        -> File: book-search.component.spec.ts

        ```
                describe('ProductListComponent', () => {}
        ```

            As the test case is related to book search component the description should be
            BookSearchComponent.
        
        ```
                describe('BookSearchComponent', () => {}
        ```

        -> File: books.effects.spec.ts
        
        ```
            describe('loadBooks$', () => {}
        ```

            As the test cases are related to searchBooks$ effect, the description shoud be 
            related to searchBooks$.

        ```
            describe('searchBooks$', () => {}
        ```

        -> Updated descriptions of all the test cases with ```should...when...``` format.


    10. File: reading-list.reducer.ts

        `addToReadingList` & `removeFromReadingList`, both are responsible for calling APIs 
        to add and remove book to and from the reading list respectively and also updates the state
        without checking the success and failure of the APIs. 
        Therefore, both should be changed to `confirmedAddToReadingList` and `confirmedRemoveFromReadingList`.

        Fixed the test cases for reading-list.reducer.ts


    11. File: book-search.component.html

        Author name, Publisher name, Published Date, and Descriptions are displayed empty for some books
        in the book search list. 

        ```
        For example : Compliance Test Reports - KWIC Index --> Author's and Publisher's name are missing.
                      Software Testing --> Description is missing.
                      test2 --> Date is missing.
        ```
        
        For better user experience, we should always provide an alternate message if the information is
        not available or mentioned.
        Fixed this issue by using ternary operator wherever applicable.

        ```
                {{ b.publisher ? b.publisher : 'No Publisher mentioned' }}
                {{ b.authors.join(',') ? b.authors.join(',') : 'No Author mentioned' }}
                {{ b.description ? b.description : 'No Description mentioned' }}
                {{ !b.publishedDate ? 'No Date mentioned' : (b.publishedDate | date: 'dd/MM/yyyy') }}
        ```

        Fixed the same issue in file: reading-list.component.html 
        
        ```
                {{ b.authors.join(',') ? b.authors.join(',') : 'No Author mentioned' }}
        ```


    12. File: book-search.component.html
        Search results are displayed based on the criteria - whether `searchTerm` is present or not. 
        When we clear the `searchTerm` in input field, the result array remains present in the state. Hence, when we type any letter in input field the previous result array will be displayed again.

        Fixed by adding - check on the result array length in `book-search.component.html`.

        ```
                <ng-container *ngIf="(books$ | async).length; else empty">
        ```


    13. Added clear button to clear out the searchTerm at once and also call clearSearch action.
        File: book-search.component.html

        ```
                <button mat-icon-butto matSuffix aria-label="Reset Search" 
                 data-testing="clear-button" (click)="resetSearch()"
                >
                <mat-icon>{{bookSearchConstants.BUTTONS.CLEAR}}</mat-icon>
        ```
            It will call resetSearch() function which will clear out the searchTerm from search
            bar and call clearSearch action.


    14. When we add a book to the reading list, the state is not updated with status isAdded as TRUE.
        So, in order to make the status isAdded as TRUE we can pass it in the addToReadingList action
        when it is dispatched.
        File: book-search.component.ts

        ```
            this.store.dispatch(addToReadingList({ book: {...book, isAdded: true} }));
        ```

        And add one more value in the book interface.
        File: index.ts (shared/models/src)

        ```
            export interface Book {
                ..
                ..
                isAdded?: boolean
            }
        ``` 
        Now, whenever we add a book to the reading list, the status isAdded will also get updated to TRUE.

    
    15. File: book-search.component.ts
        We can ommit the method ```get searchTerm()``` because the search term value can be directly
        accessed by ```this.searchForm.value.term```.
        There is no need of a separate method.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### SUGGESTIONS

    1. Sign-in and Sign-up functionality can be added so that the user can have their account 
       and can maintain the reading list.  

    2. We can have a clear button in the search field for a better user experience.

    3. We can have different categories in the reading list or we can have a filter that filters 
       out the list according to the user's choice.

    4. Application can be made responsive for mobile phones.

    5. We can have a placeholder which shifts up once user enters a keyword on the book search 
        field. Currently, the placeholder disappears as soon as the user starts typing.

#### ACCESSIBILITY


    ###### Lighthouse accessibility checks:

            1. Meta description for the app was missing. --> Fixed. 

            2. Some buttons were missing ARIA-LABEL for accessible names. --> Fixed.

            3. Contrast Background and foreground colors were not having a sufficient contrast
                ratio. --> Fixed.

            4. Focus styles are so essential for people using keyboards and keyboard emulators
                therefore, changed styling of button elements for better keyboard navigation. 


    ###### Manual accessibility checks:

            1. Reading List button on the navbar was fixed with different styling for a better 
               experience, as it was difficult to check whether it was focusable or not. -->Fixed

            2. Change in the styling of 'Want to Read' button on hover and also changed the search 
                example text color for better visibility. -->Fixed

            3. The anchor tag "JavaScript" was not accessible from the keyboard. Fixed it by making 
                it a button, added some styling, and made it keyboard focusable.

            4. Added title for book-covers image, so the browsers display title text as tooltips 
                when moused over.
